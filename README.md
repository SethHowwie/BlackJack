# BlackJack
C# implementation of BlackJack
I got some help on StackExchange for the implementation of Card and Deck. I was going to do it a bit differently, however I think this was a good way of going about it. Even though Deck.cs is hardwired for BlackJack, it would take some simple modifiyng to change the rules of whatever I wanted to exchange it to. So credit to Users Jamal and Orion31 on StackExchange, I have taken it upon myself to both modify and attempt to improve upon that specific design.
